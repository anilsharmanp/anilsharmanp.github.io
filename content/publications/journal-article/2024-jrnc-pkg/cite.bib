abstract = {Alpha-induced reactions are of pertinence in the production of radioisotopes used in varied domains including therapeutics and diagnostics. Sustained efforts are directed towards optimizing the production of such isotopes, typically using α-beams from the accelerators. Measurement of beam current remains an imperative component of the exercise and is conventionally pursued through the use of monitor reactions. The present work reports cross-section measurements of three such monitor reactions natCu(α,x)66,67Ga, 65Zn, in the energy range of Elab = 40–50 MeV where data is sparse in the existing literature. The experimental cross-sections have been reproduced in the reaction model calculations, using the TALYS framework.}
