abstract: The excitation scheme of the 69Ga (Z = 31, N = 38) nucleus has been studied following its population in 59Co(13C,2pn) reaction at Elab = 45, 50 MeV, and using an array of Compton suppressed HPGe clover detectors as the detection system. The existing level scheme has been considerably extended with identification of new γ-ray transitions and their multipolarity assignments. The level energies have been calculated in the framework of the large basis shell model and their overlap with the experimental values has been satisfactory, subject to the choice of the interaction. The band structures identified in the nucleus have been characterized with the Moment of Inertia (MOI) and aligned angular momentum, and compared to those of the similar structures in the neighboring isotopes. The shapes corresponding to these bands have been probed in the light of their Total Routhian Surface (TRS) that exhibited varied deformation characteristics, such as prolate and γ softness, associated with the individual sequences. Further, evidence of strong octupole correlation has been identified from an E3 transition between bands of opposite parities. The study comprehensively brings forth multiple aspects of single particle and collective characteristics in the level structure of 69Ga.
